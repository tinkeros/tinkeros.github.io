<a name="l2"></a>
<a name="l3"></a>The Catholic purpose of life is to know God, love God and obey God.  However, 
<a name="l4"></a>Pope Francis, wrongly said it was, &quot;to serve the other.&quot;  I am High Priest of 
<a name="l5"></a>God's official temple and I say the purpose of life is to do continual offerings 
<a name="l6"></a>to God like Cain and Abel and enjoy God's response.  Francis has a charity; I 
<a name="l7"></a>have a church. Jesus said loving God was more important than loving neighbor.  </span><span class=cB4>
<a name="l8"></a></span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22:35-40&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Matthew,22:35-40</span></a><span class=cB0>  And, He did not say with half your brain behind your back.
<a name="l9"></a>
<a name="l10"></a>You don't know God.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Chronicles+28:9-9&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>1 Chronicles,28:9-9</span></a><span class=cB0>, </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11:27-27&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Matthew,11:27-27</span></a><span class=cB0>, </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+13:25-27&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Luke,13:25-27</span></a><span class=cB0>, </span><span class=cB4>
<a name="l11"></a></span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+3:6-8&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>1 Samuel,3:6-8</span></a><span class=cB0>  You must talk with God to know Him.  With Samuel, supposedly, 
<a name="l12"></a>God took the initiative, but I think that is the exception.  Seek the Lord by 
<a name="l13"></a>taking the initiative.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11:9-10&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Luke,11:9-10</span></a><span class=cB0>
<a name="l14"></a>
<a name="l15"></a>There's something obviously different about people in the Bible compared to 
<a name="l16"></a>people today -- God talked!  Also, the people in the Bible were obsessed with 
<a name="l17"></a>doing offerings all the time.  It is required that you do offerings before God 
<a name="l18"></a>will talk.  Did the people in the Bible hear voices?  Maybe.  More likely, they 
<a name="l19"></a>used occult techniques such as an oracle.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1+Kings+6:21"><span class=cB4>1 Kings,6:21</span></a><span class=cB0>  Have you heard of 
<a name="l20"></a>&quot;tongues?&quot;  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+14:1-40&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>1 Corinthians,14:1-40</span></a><span class=cB0>  The idea is, you let yourself be puppeted by 
<a name="l21"></a>a spirit, so you say things.  You try to get a spirit -- the Holy Spirit -- to 
<a name="l22"></a>talk.  You might as well use a Ouija board.  However, it turns-out that a Ouija 
<a name="l23"></a>board is bad for technical reasons.  A really good technique is just randomly 
<a name="l24"></a>opening a book.  God told me in an oracle that it is a covenant that you hold-up 
<a name="l25"></a>your end of the conversation.  
<a name="l26"></a>
<a name="l27"></a>You can't tell if God's talking unless you have a context of conversation, but, 
<a name="l28"></a>more importantly, you are commanded to do an offering of love, like communion 
<a name="l29"></a>preparation.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1+Corinthians+11:27"><span class=cB4>1 Corinthians,11:27</span></a><span class=cB0>  When you pick a greeting card for someone, 
<a name="l30"></a>that is love effort.  If you expect God to put effort toward you, you must put 
<a name="l31"></a>effort toward Him.  God said, &quot;honest measures&quot; applies between your offering of 
<a name="l32"></a>love and His response, like a fair barter.  You get out of prayer what you put 
<a name="l33"></a>into it.  God wants praise, hymns, or whatever you think He might want.  Try and 
<a name="l34"></a>see, like Cain and Abel.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4:1-10&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Genesis,4:1-10</span></a><span class=cB0>, </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Ephesians+5:10"><span class=cB4>Ephesians,5:10</span></a><span class=cB0>  God told Cain his 
<a name="l35"></a>offering was not good and told him to try again.  Cain really loved God!  Can 
<a name="l36"></a>you imagine being so heart-broken?
<a name="l37"></a>
<a name="l38"></a>Do a text search for &quot;new song&quot; in the Bible.  It's mentioned nine times.  When 
<a name="l39"></a>I hear a NEW awesome rock song, it is ecstasy for the first five times I hear 
<a name="l40"></a>it.  Soon, it brings little-to-no pleasure.  I did </span><span class=cB9><u>hymns</u></span><span class=cB0> for God.  I also did 
<a name="l41"></a>Moses comics for God.  When you get to the gates of Heaven, St. Peter will ask 
<a name="l42"></a>how many times you gave blood.  That shows you loved neighbor.  You better also 
<a name="l43"></a>be able to count the ways you loved God with all heart, mind and soul.  I 
<a name="l44"></a>praised God for sand castles, popcorn, snowmen, bubbles...  You try putting 
<a name="l45"></a>effort into praise!  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew+11:25"><span class=cB4>Matthew,11:25</span></a><span class=cB0>, </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6:28-29&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Matthew,6:28-29</span></a><span class=cB0>  Solomon wrote a thousand 
<a name="l46"></a>songs.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+4:30-32&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>1 Kings,4:30-32</span></a><span class=cB0>
<a name="l47"></a>
<a name="l48"></a>This is funny -- </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2:1-13&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Acts,2:1-13</span></a><span class=cB0> -- they didn't bother to record anything the Holy 
<a name="l49"></a>Spirit said.  The Holy Spirit is supposed to be a really good gift.  </span><span class=cB4>
<a name="l50"></a></span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11:11-13&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Luke,11:11-13</span></a><span class=cB0>  Just remember, &quot;Boys are made of snakes and snails and puppy-dog 
<a name="l51"></a>tails.&quot;
<a name="l52"></a>
<a name="l53"></a>The technique I use to consult the Holy Spirit is reading a microsecond-range 
<a name="l54"></a>stop-watch each button press for random numbers.  Then, I pick words with </span><span class=cB2>&lt;F7&gt;</span><span class=cB0> 
<a name="l55"></a>or passages with </span><span class=cB2>&lt;SHIFT-F7&gt;</span><span class=cB0>.
<a name="l56"></a>
<a name="l57"></a>Since seeking the word of the Holy Spirit, I have come to know God much better 
<a name="l58"></a>than I've heard others explain.  For example, God said to me in an oracle that 
<a name="l59"></a>war was, &quot;servicemen competing.&quot;  That sounds more like the immutable God of our 
<a name="l60"></a>planet than what you hear from most religious people.  God is not Venus (god of 
<a name="l61"></a>love) and not Mars (god of war), He's our dearly beloved God of Earth.  If 
<a name="l62"></a>Mammon is a false god of money, Mars or Venus might be useful words to describe 
<a name="l63"></a>other false gods.  I figure the greatest challenge for the Creator is boredom, 
<a name="l64"></a>ours and His.  What would teen-age male video games be like if war had never 
<a name="l65"></a>happened?  Christ said live by the sword, die by the sword, which is loving 
<a name="l66"></a>neighbor as self.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew+26:52"><span class=cB4>Matthew,26:52</span></a><span class=cB0>
<a name="l67"></a>
<a name="l68"></a>I asked God if the World was perfectly just.  God asked if I was calling Him 
<a name="l69"></a>lazy.  God could make A.I., right?  God could make bots as smart as Himself, or, 
<a name="l70"></a>in fact, part of Himself.  What if God made a bot to manipulate every person's 
<a name="l71"></a>life so that perfect justice happened?
<a name="l72"></a>
<a name="l73"></a>I think highs and lows balance.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6:20-26&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Luke,6:20-26</span></a><span class=cB0>  If you laugh, you will cry.  If 
<a name="l74"></a>you cry, you will laugh.  Not one person has had great joy and not great sorrow. 
<a name="l75"></a> I think this claim is falsifyable if you atheists want to find a 
<a name="l76"></a>counter-example to disprove it -- find a single person who had great joy and not 
<a name="l77"></a>great sorrow.  In Sirach, it says things happen in pairs.  You might be 
<a name="l78"></a>surprised examining your own life to see great joy was in proximity to great 
<a name="l79"></a>sorrow.  Pleasures and pains seem designed to balance.  Man must do manual labor 
<a name="l80"></a>and have pain.  Women must do child birth.  Pride and humility also balance -- 
<a name="l81"></a>pride before a fall and humility before honors.  Palm Sunday is juxtaposed to 
<a name="l82"></a>Good Friday.  Perhaps, being loved balances with being hated.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1:1-22&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Job,1:1-22</span></a><span class=cB0>, in 
<a name="l83"></a>the Bible, had highs and lows that balanced.  Joseph, in the Old Testament, had 
<a name="l84"></a>highs and lows that balanced.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+39:17-22&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Genesis,39:17-22</span></a><span class=cB0> 
<a name="l85"></a>
<a name="l86"></a>Jesus said, &quot;Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who tresspass against 
<a name="l87"></a>us.&quot;  If you think about it, the only way you get forgiven is for it to be done 
<a name="l88"></a>to you.  That is a Jedi mind trick because it is nothing but simple eye-for-eye 
<a name="l89"></a>tooth-for-tooth justice.  Live by the sword; die by the sword.  The Bible is 
<a name="l90"></a>filled with justice pairs.  St. Paul persecuted Christians and gained 
<a name="l91"></a>forgiveness by getting persecuted.  King David almost got killed by Saul, </span><span class=cB4>
<a name="l92"></a></span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+18:20-21&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>1 Samuel,18:20-21</span></a><span class=cB0> then he killed a guy and took his wife.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/2+Samuel+11:15"><span class=cB4>2 Samuel,11:15</span></a><span class=cB0>  
<a name="l93"></a>Abraham almost killed his unloved son, Ishmael.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Genesis+21:16"><span class=cB4>Genesis,21:16</span></a><span class=cB0>  That is why God 
<a name="l94"></a>asked Abraham to kill Isaac.  God's favorite thing on TV is soap operas.
<a name="l95"></a>
<a name="l96"></a>God hates complaining. </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+11:1-35&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Numbers,11:1-35</span></a><span class=cB0>  Food and clothing is all we're to ask 
<a name="l97"></a>for or demand, in fact -- daily bread.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1+Timothy+6:8"><span class=cB4>1 Timothy,6:8</span></a><span class=cB0>  Just think about man in 
<a name="l98"></a>the last 50,000 years mostly living like Native Americans and how God must see 
<a name="l99"></a>us.  You need food, clothing and entertainment, money is to get those.  Man does 
<a name="l100"></a>not live on bread alone.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Luke+4:4"><span class=cB4>Luke,4:4</span></a><span class=cB0>, </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+8:11-12&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Amos,8:11-12</span></a><span class=cB0>
<a name="l101"></a>
<a name="l102"></a>God's favorite animals are bears and elephants.  They are funny shaped -- I 
<a name="l103"></a>think God must have seen too much starvation over the years.  If the purpose of 
<a name="l104"></a>life is to know and love God, then a priest's job is to make everybody know and 
<a name="l105"></a>love God.  By saying God likes bears and elephants, I did more toward that end 
<a name="l106"></a>than all priests in history.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Hosea+6:6"><span class=cB4>Hosea,6:6</span></a><span class=cB0>  &quot;It is love that I desire, not 
<a name="l107"></a>sacrifice; knowledge of God, not holocaust.&quot;  As a former Catholic, that blew my 
<a name="l108"></a>mind.  I actually thought love was sacrifice!  I was so dumb-founded reading, 
<a name="l109"></a>&quot;it is love that I desire, not sacrifice,&quot; that I actually looked-up the word, 
<a name="l110"></a>&quot;love&quot;.  It means to take delight in.  I realized it is demonic pride if you 
<a name="l111"></a>think love means hurting yourself for others.  In the Philippians, they got the 
<a name="l112"></a>notion crucifying yourself was a good idea.  Similarly, a child thinking about 
<a name="l113"></a>Lent, might conclude, &quot;if it's bad, it must be good.&quot;  That is, if you think God 
<a name="l114"></a>wants you to hurt yourself to please Him, you are worshiping a demon, not God!  
<a name="l115"></a>God wants you to take delight in His company, get to know Him and praise Him.  
<a name="l116"></a>It is best to separate justice -- sin and punishment -- from relationship with 
<a name="l117"></a>God.  Never ask God to change justice into injustice by not punishing.  God said 
<a name="l118"></a>to me in an oracle, &quot;Excessive contrician wearisome.&quot;  He doesn't want to hear 
<a name="l119"></a>confessions.  When you pray, be witty and charming and rarely earnest.  Enjoy 
<a name="l120"></a>God's company without imposing on Him and don't expect secrets of the Universe.  
<a name="l121"></a>Earnestness in prayer is the root of much evil.  Be entertaining.  Don't remind 
<a name="l122"></a>Him of sin, LOL.
<a name="l123"></a>
<a name="l124"></a>God's ways are far above man's ways.  Mom said Heaven was a never-ending family 
<a name="l125"></a>reunion.  Yikes!  A friend said, &quot;Most guy's idea of Heaven would be running 
<a name="l126"></a>around doing things they'd get locked up for on Earth.&quot;  I wonder how long kids 
<a name="l127"></a>play Grand Theft Auto before getting board.  Perhaps, it takes ten years, but 
<a name="l128"></a>they will get bored.  Most people are like King Midas.  When you realize how 
<a name="l129"></a>silly most notions of Heaven are, you come to appreciate that Earth is not that 
<a name="l130"></a>bad.  This is the first step in loving God, the Creator -- praising Creation.  
<a name="l131"></a>My parents spend their retired days watching TV and going to casinos.  That's 
<a name="l132"></a>not a good argument for getting extended-play!
<a name="l133"></a>
<a name="l134"></a>Imagine a billionare.  Everyone around him can't forget his money for even a 
<a name="l135"></a>moment.  The truth is, most people are after God's &quot;money&quot; -- they fear for 
<a name="l136"></a>their salvation.  Here's a test -- would you pray to and praise God even if 
<a name="l137"></a>there were no salvation?  Love God and don't be a &quot;user&quot;.  Asking for stuff is 
<a name="l138"></a>annoying.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11:5-7&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Luke,11:5-7</span></a><span class=cB0>  Don't SPAM God. 
<a name="l139"></a>
<a name="l140"></a>All those sophisticated theological &quot;infinity&quot; things -- omniscience, 
<a name="l141"></a>omnipotence, omnipresence, omnivorous -- will mess you up.  Trust me that 
<a name="l142"></a>anthropomorphic is far better, in practice.  Christ suggested thinking of God as 
<a name="l143"></a>&quot;Abba&quot; which is Aramaic for &quot;Daddy&quot; and said the childlike had an advantage.  </span><span class=cB4>
<a name="l144"></a></span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew+11:25"><span class=cB4>Matthew,11:25</span></a><span class=cB0>  Pray out-loud because God doesn't want the hastle of reading your 
<a name="l145"></a>brain.  The best way to stop people from testing God is to suggest He can't do 
<a name="l146"></a>everything.
<a name="l147"></a>
<a name="l148"></a>Jesus said, &quot;I am meek and humble of heart.&quot;  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew+11:29"><span class=cB4>Matthew,11:29</span></a><span class=cB0>  What does &quot;humble 
<a name="l149"></a>of head&quot; mean?  Humble of heart means you look around and say, &quot;I don't care as 
<a name="l150"></a>much as they do.&quot;  A proud of heart person says, &quot;I am superior because I have 
<a name="l151"></a>more compassion then everybody else.&quot;  If you are proud of heart, you don't 
<a name="l152"></a>accept a gift.  God gives birthrights.  Esau, in the Bible, scorned his 
<a name="l153"></a>birthright and God hated him.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+1:2-3&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Malachi,1:2-3</span></a><span class=cB0>  Jesus even accepted $30,000 worth 
<a name="l154"></a>of perfume (300 day's wages) and caused Judas to betray him.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Mark+14:5"><span class=cB4>Mark,14:5</span></a><span class=cB0>  If you 
<a name="l155"></a>express false outrage at wars, you are proud of heart.  If you fight to go in 
<a name="l156"></a>the door last, e.g. &quot;No, you first...&quot; then you are proud of heart.  If you ask 
<a name="l157"></a>God to save starving Africans as though you care more than God, you are proud of 
<a name="l158"></a>heart.
<a name="l159"></a>
<a name="l160"></a>I connected being humble of heart with animal sacrifices.  The animal sacrifices 
<a name="l161"></a>in the Bible really seem off-the-mark from what we modern people imagine truth 
<a name="l162"></a>to be!  I asked God and He said the people were, &quot;primitive.&quot;  Well, obviously, 
<a name="l163"></a>a sacrifice represents giving-up something of value, but is there more to it?  
<a name="l164"></a>It would be tramatic to see a goat's throat being slit and it dying for your 
<a name="l165"></a>sins.  I'm not an expert, but sometimes they killed animals to make-up for sins. 
<a name="l166"></a>Perhaps, starting at age eight and every year thereafter, they kill a goat for 
<a name="l167"></a>your sins?  (I'm just speculating.)  In a couple years, it is not tramatic and 
<a name="l168"></a>you yawn and say to the goat, &quot;bummer for you, Mr. Goat, that you gotta die for 
<a name="l169"></a>my sins.&quot;  When a high school football team beats their rivals, nobody thinks 
<a name="l170"></a>twice that the winning team really hurts the feelings -- devastates -- the 
<a name="l171"></a>losing team member's feelings.  The heart of being masculine is being 
<a name="l172"></a>competetive and not caring about the necessity to slit the throat of the goat.  
<a name="l173"></a>As a Catholic, saying Jesus died for our sins and that we cannot earn salvation, 
<a name="l174"></a>never sat well.  I clung to the heretical notion that you earn salvation.  
<a name="l175"></a>Animal sacrifices were the heart of Biblical Judaism and although it seems 
<a name="l176"></a>satanic, you really do have to slit the throat of the goat and accept grace, a 
<a name="l177"></a>term for something you did not earn.  Heck, every time you eat beef, a cow had 
<a name="l178"></a>to die for you.  God said to me in an oracle that having pets was, &quot;homo.&quot;  I 
<a name="l179"></a>think God's idea of pets is farm animals you eat.
<a name="l180"></a>
<a name="l181"></a>If you feel guilty for being American and want Mexicans to share your 
<a name="l182"></a>birthright, you are proud of heart.  Would it be right for rich Arabs to have to 
<a name="l183"></a>share their oil money with Indian slaves?  Jesus was a racist and called 
<a name="l184"></a>Canaanites &quot;dogs&quot;.  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+15:22-28&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Matthew,15:22-28</span></a><span class=cB0>  In an oracle, God told me He was against

<a name="l189"></a>In an ant colony, the workers have one set of marching orders, the soldiers have 
<a name="l190"></a>another set of marching orders, the queen and drones have marching orders and 
<a name="l191"></a>the diggers have marching orders.  The Bible gives conflicting orders -- 
<a name="l192"></a>conservatives pay attention to one set of passages and liberals pay attention to 
<a name="l193"></a>others.  Everybody has selective hearing, but that's good because we are 
<a name="l194"></a>different members of the body of Christ.
<a name="l195"></a>
<a name="l196"></a>Jesus repeats the phrase, &quot;for those who have ears to hear&quot; many times.  (But, 
<a name="l197"></a>not actually at the times that matter.)  Jesus says several Jedi mind tricks -- 
<a name="l198"></a>He asks, what father gives a scorpion to his son?  </span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11:11-13&version=NIV"><span class=cB4>Luke,11:11-13</span></a><span class=cB0> Jesus says, 
<a name="l199"></a>when you ask God for things, it is as annoying as like a neighbor in the night!  </span><span class=cB4>

<a name="l203"></a>There are sheep and there are shepherds.  You would be silly to take other 
<a name="l204"></a>shepherds seriously when they are only caring for their sheep.  Sheep are very 
<a name="l205"></a>hard to communicate to, as Jesus learned.  He used parables.  Seed on a path 
<a name="l206"></a>gets eaten by birds; weeds choke; and the one percent is rich soil.
<a name="l207"></a>
<a name="l208"></a>Just as ego causes most to love neighbor, not God, people skip knowing and 
<a name="l209"></a>loving God and cowardly get stuck on obeying Him.  A desire to obey God, doesn't 
<a name="l210"></a>have to be encouraged, since it comes so naturally.  Don't worry, God does not 
<a name="l211"></a>want pawns to push around.  God will talk, but won't tell you what to do, even 
<a name="l212"></a>if you want Him to.  Also, you'll quickly learn that when God talks to you 
<a name="l213"></a>seemingly prophetic, it does not come true and should smack yourself for wanting 
<a name="l214"></a>more than just enjoying God's company.
