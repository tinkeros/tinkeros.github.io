<a name="l3"></a>
<a name="l4"></a></span><span class=cB5>God, Terry, and TempleOS:</span><span class=cB0>
<a name="l5"></a>
<a name="l6"></a>I appreciate TempleOS because it is clear that in creating it Terry had hoped to 
<a name="l7"></a>make something that pleased God.  It may very well be the case God helped guide 
<a name="l8"></a>him while working on it because he had respect for God.  I have often felt God 
<a name="l9"></a>help me when I've been stuck during programming and ask God for help.  I believe 
<a name="l10"></a>God helped me find and fix issues while working on TinkerOS and God helped Terry 
<a name="l11"></a>be more than he could be and do more than he could do on his own.  This does NOT 
<a name="l12"></a>mean God condoned any of Terry's behavior by any means.  There are many many 
<a name="l13"></a>figures in the Bible who God helps that are great sinners who do horrible 
<a name="l14"></a>things.  God helped King David though he killed Bathsheba's husband to take her 
<a name="l15"></a>as his wife.  Samson slept with prostitutes and decided to marry outside his 
<a name="l16"></a>faith yet was given great strength.  The apostle Paul murdered Christians.  God 
<a name="l17"></a>can help people to repent and do good works despite their sin.  Part of the 
<a name="l18"></a>problem of today's cancel culture is that at times we cancel a sinful persons 
<a name="l19"></a>good works and in some cases those works might have even been produced by God 
<a name="l20"></a>working through that sinful person.  I'm a sinner, Terry was a sinner.  But I 
<a name="l21"></a>recognize good in TempleOS.  Terry claimed to be the smartest programmer in the 
<a name="l22"></a>world and to possess divine intellect.  Do I believe it?  Yes and no.  No, 
<a name="l23"></a>because he made the claim himself (his ego got in the way because of his 
<a name="l24"></a>illness, sin or both).  Yes, because I think it is very likely God touched his 
<a name="l25"></a>mind and helped him to make something beautiful and unique.  As you look at 
<a name="l26"></a>TempleOS appreciate and meditate on the fact that God can do amazing things 
<a name="l27"></a>through people despite their sin.
<a name="l28"></a>
<a name="l29"></a>I do NOT believe TempleOS is the 3rd Temple.  Jesus is the 3rd Temple.  Jesus 
<a name="l30"></a>said he could destroy the temple and rebuild it in 3 days (and He did, the new 
<a name="l31"></a>Temple is our Lord Jesus who resurrected in 3 days).
<a name="l32"></a>
<a name="l33"></a>Whatever you do have respect for God.  God probably cut Terry some slack due to 
<a name="l34"></a>his mental condition, He likely expects much better behavior from you.  Whatever 
<a name="l35"></a>you program in TempleOS, make it something that is respectful of God.
<a name="l36"></a>
<a name="l37"></a></span><span class=cB5>Experiences with God:</span><span class=cB0>
<a name="l38"></a>
<a name="l39"></a>The closest thing I have gotten to an experience of getting a message from God 
<a name="l40"></a>related to TempleOS was when I seemed to hear words which corresponded to the 
<a name="l41"></a>notes in the song risen.  I made a video about it: </span><a href="https://youtu.be/JCi4ZSQod5U"><span class=cB4>Easter message in Risen?</span></a><span class=cB0>
<a name="l42"></a>
<a name="l43"></a>I've had numerous definitively answered prayers.  I've prayed for help and have 
<a name="l44"></a>had people come up to me out of the blue and offer assistance with the exact 
<a name="l45"></a>problem I prayed about less than 5 minutes later.  Other times a response comes 
<a name="l46"></a>and it is clearly a response, but not on a timeline or in a way I would have 
<a name="l47"></a>expected.
<a name="l48"></a>
<a name="l49"></a>I feel like I have experienced God letting me know He is present with all my 
<a name="l50"></a>senses at one point or another.  I'm Catholic, on occasion I've seen consicrated 
<a name="l51"></a>hosts shimmer before me, on occasion they have had an unexpected sweet taste 
<a name="l52"></a>though typically the communion hosts are usually fairly bland and tasteless.   
<a name="l53"></a>During aduration or after confessoin I have experienced the scent of flowers 
<a name="l54"></a>randomly when there are none.  At times in church during singing it seems as if 
<a name="l55"></a>additional voices are added and everything becomes louder and more beautiful as 
<a name="l56"></a>if angels had joined to sing with us.  It is as if at times through various 
<a name="l57"></a>senses God is just simply letting me know, I'm here.
<a name="l58"></a>
<a name="l59"></a></span><span class=cB5>Communicating with God, Oracles and TempleOS:</span><span class=cB0>
<a name="l60"></a>
<a name="l61"></a>I do NOT believe it is appropriate to use TempleOS/TinkerOS as an oracle. God 
<a name="l62"></a>hears prayers and responds to worthy prayers from worthy people.  I have had 
<a name="l63"></a>nearly instant answers to prayers at times, but typically I must patiently wait 
<a name="l64"></a>for a response.  It is foolish and incredibly egotistical to think that the God 
<a name="l65"></a>who created the entire universe would respond to you upon demand by offing up a 
<a name="l66"></a>simplistic offering done on a computer followed by asking a question and then 
<a name="l67"></a>demanding an immediate response from random words drawn from a limited 
<a name="l68"></a>dictionary by you mashing the keyboard to be interpreted as an answer.  It is 
<a name="l69"></a>clear from the Bible that God works though people and shows them signs.   Pray 
<a name="l70"></a>respectfully, be patient and wait.  Also don't be disappointed if you don't get 
<a name="l71"></a>what you ask for.  There have been many instances in my life where when I think 
<a name="l72"></a>about things retrospectively I am very happy I did not get what I asked for at 
<a name="l73"></a>the time.  God knows what is best for you, way better than you yourself know.
<a name="l74"></a>
<a name="l75"></a>I have never used TempleOS or TinkerOS as an oracle.  I added output of random 
<a name="l76"></a>words and Bible verses in my Sudoku game just for fun.
<a name="l77"></a>
<a name="l78"></a>Although I strongly disagree with the naming of the functions which generate 
<a name="l79"></a>words, bible verses and songs (GodWord, GodBiblePassage, GodSong, etc) I have 
<a name="l80"></a>kept their names as is to maintain backwards compatibility with TempleOS apps.  
<a name="l81"></a>Again I reiterate, if you want God to talk to you be respectful, pray, and 
<a name="l82"></a>patiently wait.  Do NOT toss out a simplistic offering on a computer along with 
<a name="l83"></a>a question and then mash the keyboard expecting a response of any value.
