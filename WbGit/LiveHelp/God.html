<a name="l3"></a>
<a name="l4"></a></span><span class=cB5>God, Terry, and TempleOS:</span><span class=cB0>
<a name="l5"></a>
<a name="l6"></a>I appreciate TempleOS because it is clear that in creating it Terry had hoped to 
<a name="l7"></a>make something that pleased God.  It may very well be the case God helped guide 
<a name="l8"></a>him while working on it because he had respect for God.  I have often felt God 
<a name="l9"></a>help me when I've been stuck during programming and ask God for help.  I believe 
<a name="l10"></a>God helped me find and fix issues while working on TinkerOS and God helped Terry 
<a name="l11"></a>be more than he could be and do more than he could do on his own.
<a name="l12"></a>
<a name="l13"></a>This does NOT mean God condoned any of Terry's behavior by any means.  There are 
<a name="l14"></a>many many figures in the Bible who God helps that are great sinners who do 
<a name="l15"></a>horrible things.  God helped King David though he killed Bathsheba's husband to 
<a name="l16"></a>take her as his wife.  Samson slept with prostitutes and decided to marry 
<a name="l17"></a>outside his faith yet was given great strength.  The apostle Paul murdered 
<a name="l18"></a>Christians.  God can help people to repent and do good works despite their sin.  
<a name="l19"></a>Part of the problem of today's cancel culture is that at times we cancel a 
<a name="l20"></a>sinful persons good works and in some cases those works might have even been 
<a name="l21"></a>produced by God working through that sinful person.
<a name="l22"></a>
<a name="l23"></a>I'm a sinner, Terry was a sinner, but I recognize good in TempleOS.  Terry 
<a name="l24"></a>claimed to be the smartest programmer in the world and to possess divine 
<a name="l25"></a>intellect.  Do I believe it?  Yes and no.  No, because he made the claim himself 
<a name="l26"></a>(his ego got in the way because of his illness, sin or both).  Yes, because I 
<a name="l27"></a>think it is very likely God touched his mind and helped him to make something 
<a name="l28"></a>beautiful and unique.  As you look at TempleOS appreciate and meditate on the 
<a name="l29"></a>fact that God can do amazing things through people despite their metal illness 
<a name="l30"></a>and sin.
<a name="l31"></a>
<a name="l32"></a>I do NOT believe TempleOS is the 3rd Temple.  Why?  It is clear from the Bible 
<a name="l33"></a>Jesus is the 3rd Temple.  If Terry had read and understood the entire Bible and 
<a name="l34"></a>Catechism of the Catholic Church, he clealy would have known this.  I am 
<a name="l35"></a>Catholic and I know the sad reality is most Catholics do not attend church 
<a name="l36"></a>regularly, have not read the Bible and certainly have not read the Catechism of 
<a name="l37"></a>the Catholic Church.  I have read them all and more.  If he did read them, then 
<a name="l38"></a>the words got distored in his mind.  
<a name="l39"></a>
<a name="l40"></a>John 2:19-21 Jesus answered them, &quot;Destroy this temple, and I will raise it 
<a name="l41"></a>again in three days.&quot; They replied, &quot;It has taken forty-six years to build this 
<a name="l42"></a>temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?&quot; But the temple he had 
<a name="l43"></a>spoken of was His body.  (and He did rebuilt it, the new Temple is our Lord 
<a name="l44"></a>Jesus who resurrected in 3 days).  
<a name="l45"></a>
<a name="l46"></a>John 4:21 &quot;a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this 
<a name="l47"></a>mountain nor in Jerusalem.&quot; Jesus made it clear temple worship will be over 
<a name="l48"></a>because He knew the temple of His own body would replace it.
<a name="l49"></a>
<a name="l50"></a></span><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1N.HTM#-P9"><span class=cB0>Catholic Catechism paragraph 593</span></a><span class=cB0>: &quot;Jesus venerated the Temple by going up to it 
<a name="l51"></a>for the Jewish feasts of pilgrimage, and with a jealous love he loved this 
<a name="l52"></a>dwelling of God among men. the Temple prefigures his own mystery. When he 
<a name="l53"></a>announces its destruction, it is as a manifestation of his own execution and of 
<a name="l54"></a>the entry into a new age in the history of salvation, when his Body would be the 
<a name="l55"></a>definitive Temple.&quot;
<a name="l56"></a>
<a name="l57"></a>Listen to it here </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg-e6qxPxjE"><span class=cB0>Jesus and the Temple</span></a><span class=cB0> for some good commentary that goes along 
<a name="l58"></a>with the related Catechism section.
<a name="l59"></a>
<a name="l60"></a>Whatever you do have respect for God.  God probably cut Terry some slack due to 
<a name="l61"></a>his mental condition, He likely expects much better behavior from you.  Whatever 
<a name="l62"></a>you program in TempleOS, make it something that is respectful of God.
<a name="l63"></a>
<a name="l64"></a></span><span class=cB5>Experiences with God:</span><span class=cB0>
<a name="l65"></a>
<a name="l66"></a>The closest thing I have gotten to an experience of getting a message from God 
<a name="l67"></a>related to TempleOS was when I seemed to hear words which corresponded to the 
<a name="l68"></a>notes in the song risen.  I made a video about it: </span><a href="https://youtu.be/JCi4ZSQod5U"><span class=cB4>Easter message in Risen?</span></a><span class=cB0>
<a name="l69"></a>
<a name="l70"></a>I've had numerous definitively answered prayers.  I've prayed for help and have 
<a name="l71"></a>had people come up to me out of the blue and offer assistance with the exact 
<a name="l72"></a>problem I prayed about less than 5 minutes later.  Other times a response comes 
<a name="l73"></a>and it is clearly a response, but not on a timeline or in a way I would have 
<a name="l74"></a>expected.
<a name="l75"></a>
<a name="l76"></a>I feel like I have experienced God letting me know He is present with all my 
<a name="l77"></a>senses at one point or another.  I'm Catholic, on occasion I've seen consicrated 
<a name="l78"></a>hosts shimmer before me, on occasion they have had an unexpected sweet taste 
<a name="l79"></a>though typically the communion hosts are usually fairly bland and tasteless.   
<a name="l80"></a>During aduration or after confessoin I have experienced the scent of flowers 
<a name="l81"></a>randomly when there are none.  At times in church during singing it seems as if 
<a name="l82"></a>additional voices are added and everything becomes louder and more beautiful as 
<a name="l83"></a>if angels had joined to sing with us.  It is as if at times through various 
<a name="l84"></a>senses God is just simply letting me know, I'm here.
<a name="l85"></a>
<a name="l86"></a></span><span class=cB5>Communicating with God, Oracles and TempleOS:</span><span class=cB0>
<a name="l87"></a>
<a name="l88"></a>I do NOT believe it is appropriate to use TempleOS/TinkerOS as an oracle. God 
<a name="l89"></a>hears prayers and responds to worthy prayers from worthy people.  I have had 
<a name="l90"></a>nearly instant answers to prayers at times, but typically I must patiently wait 
<a name="l91"></a>for a response.  It is foolish and incredibly egotistical to think that the God 
<a name="l92"></a>who created the entire universe would respond to you upon demand by offering up 
<a name="l93"></a>a simplistic offering done on a computer followed by asking a question and then 
<a name="l94"></a>demanding an immediate response from random words drawn from a limited 
<a name="l95"></a>dictionary by you mashing the keyboard to be interpreted as an answer.  It is 
<a name="l96"></a>clear from the Bible that God works though people and shows them signs.  Pray 
<a name="l97"></a>respectfully, be patient and wait.  Also don't be disappointed if you don't get 
<a name="l98"></a>what you ask for.  There have been many instances in my life where when I think 
<a name="l99"></a>about things retrospectively I am very happy I did not get what I asked for at 
<a name="l100"></a>the time.  God knows what is best for you, way better than you yourself know.
<a name="l101"></a>
<a name="l102"></a>I have never used TempleOS or TinkerOS as an oracle.  I added output of random 
<a name="l103"></a>words and Bible verses in my Sudoku game just for fun.
<a name="l104"></a>
<a name="l105"></a>Although I strongly disagree with the naming of the functions which generate 
<a name="l106"></a>words, bible verses and songs (GodWord, GodBiblePassage, GodSong, etc) I have 
<a name="l107"></a>kept their names as is to maintain backwards compatibility with TempleOS apps.  
<a name="l108"></a>Again I reiterate, if you want God to talk to you be respectful, pray, and 
<a name="l109"></a>patiently wait.  Do NOT toss out a simplistic offering on a computer along with 
<a name="l110"></a>a question and then mash the keyboard expecting a response of any value.
