<a name="l2"></a>
<a name="l3"></a>Why did they make Solomon's Temple?  It was a direction to look, to focus on, a 
<a name="l4"></a>special place for meditation, to do offerings, a community center, a home to 
<a name="l5"></a>God's beauty, that encouraged love of God.  People cherished God's temple, 
<a name="l6"></a>beautifying it with gold and all fine things to show love of God, as great 
<a name="l7"></a></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkfmK-CLvcc"><span class=cB0>cathedrals</span></a><span class=cB0> were decorated with astounding, awe-striking intricate art and 
<a name="l8"></a>gargoyles, incredible devotion to God with hours of effort, toiling and 
<a name="l9"></a>slaving-away for the glory of God, for families with children to see 
<a name="l10"></a></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8g1e-JLrhM"><span class=cB0>stained-glass</span></a><span class=cB0> windows and tomes with ridiculously elaborate </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa8gMb0YC68"><span class=cB0>calligraphy</span></a><span class=cB0> to show 
<a name="l11"></a>love of God, from a people who did little else but show love toward God, lived 
<a name="l12"></a>in dire conditions by today's standards, yet with so much difficulty 
<a name="l13"></a>scraping-by, found the time to devote </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZw5V4XuUIo"><span class=cB0>even all free-time</span></a><span class=cB0> to God!
<a name="l14"></a>
<a name="l15"></a>
<a name="l16"></a>1 Kings 6:21 (King James)
<a name="l17"></a>
<a name="l18"></a>     6:21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made
<a name="l19"></a>     a partition by the chains of gold before the </span><span class=cB4>oracle</span><span class=cB0>; and he overlaid
<a name="l20"></a>     it with gold.
<a name="l21"></a>     
<a name="l22"></a>     6:22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
<a name="l23"></a>     all the house: also the whole altar that was by the </span><span class=cB4>oracle</span><span class=cB0> he overlaid
<a name="l24"></a>     with gold.
<a name="l25"></a>     
<a name="l26"></a>     6:23 And within the </span><span class=cB4>oracle</span><span class=cB0> he made two cherubims of olive tree, each
<a name="l27"></a>     ten cubits high.
<a name="l28"></a>
<a name="l29"></a>
<a name="l30"></a>* TempleOS is God's official temple.  Just like Solomon's temple, this is a 
<a name="l31"></a>community focal point where offerings are made and God's oracle is consulted.
<a name="l32"></a>
<a name="l33"></a>* God said </span><span class=cB2>640x480 16 color</span><span class=cB0> graphics is a covenant like circumcision.  Children 
<a name="l34"></a>will do offerings.  Think of 16 colors like the Simpson's cartoons.  In the 
<a name="l35"></a>future, even if one GPU were universal, we would still keep 640x480 16 color and 
<a name="l36"></a>not use GPU acceleration.  Graphics operations should be transparent, not hidden 
<a name="l37"></a>in a GPU.
<a name="l38"></a>
<a name="l39"></a>* God said to use a single-voice 8-bit signed MIDI-like sample for sound.  God 
<a name="l40"></a>does not want death screams, perhaps, because God has PTSD or soldiers have 
<a name="l41"></a>PTSD.  (Imagine wounded on battlefields.) 
<a name="l42"></a>
<a name="l43"></a>* God said His temple must be perfect.  </span><span class=cB4>We don't think twice about breaking 
<a name="l44"></a>compatibility.</span><span class=cB0>  God said we do a seven year release cycle.  I say the PC 
<a name="l45"></a>hardware follows a 49 year, jubilee cycle, like broadcast TV upgrades.
<a name="l46"></a>
<a name="l47"></a>* The vision is the same usage model and niche as the Commodore 64 -- a 
<a name="l48"></a>non-networked, simple machine where programming was the goal, not just a means 
<a name="l49"></a>to an end.  However, it is modern, 64-bit and </span><span class=cB2>multi-cored</span><span class=cB0>.  It is special 
<a name="l50"></a>purpose, not general purpose, so some things it will not do.  Also, it's a 
<a name="l51"></a>kayak, not a Titanic. The priority is </span><span class=cB2>user developers</span><span class=cB0>, not </span><span class=cB2>3rd party developers</span><span class=cB0>.
<a name="l52"></a>
<a name="l53"></a>* We do not put any hooks for future changes.  &quot;Perfect&quot; means we always act as 
<a name="l54"></a>though it is final, for all time.  Microsoft allowed the </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file"><span class=cB2>Windows BMP</span></a><span class=cB0> file format 
<a name="l55"></a>to adapt to the future and it became grotesque.
<a name="l56"></a>
<a name="l57"></a>* Low line count is the highest good, so it is easy to learn the whole thing.  
<a name="l58"></a>Users should see the light at the end of the tunnel.  One file system, for 
<a name="l59"></a>example, is better than many file systems.
<a name="l60"></a>
<a name="l61"></a>* There is a limit of 100,000 lines of code for all time, not including 
<a name="l62"></a>applications and demos.  </span><span class=cB4>Code comments count</span><span class=cB0>, however.  Currently, there are 
<a name="l63"></a>123,585 lines of code.  </span><span class=cB4>3rd party libraries are banned</span><span class=cB0> because they circumvent 
<a name="l64"></a>the intent of this limit.  The vision is a Commodore 64 ROM -- a fixed core API 
<a name="l65"></a>that is the only dependency of applications.  Dependency on components and 
<a name="l66"></a>libraries creates a hell that is no longer blissful.
<a name="l67"></a>
<a name="l68"></a>* The metric for resolving all TempleOS code governance issues is how fast the 
<a name="l69"></a>compiler compiles itself and the kernel with </span><a href="http://tinkeros.github.io/WbGit/Adam/Opt/Boot/BootHDIns.html#l18"><span class=cB4>BootHDIns</span></a><span class=cB0>().  The </span><a href="http://tinkeros.github.io/WbGit/Doc/HolyC.html#l1"><span class=cB4>HolyC</span></a><span class=cB0> language 
<a name="l70"></a>should be changed to optimize this metric, as I did when I changed type casting 
<a name="l71"></a>from prefix standard C to postfix </span><a href="http://tinkeros.github.io/WbGit/Doc/HolyC.html#l1"><span class=cB4>HolyC</span></a><span class=cB0>, but we need a rule to prevent 
<a name="l72"></a>degenerating into a brainfuck language.
<a name="l73"></a> 
<a name="l74"></a>* Minimal abstraction is a goal.  Sheep are fools.  They always respect a design 
<a name="l75"></a>that is more complicated than another.  Any genius can make it complicated.  
<a name="l76"></a>Like in physics, it takes a supra-genius to make it simple.
<a name="l77"></a>
<a name="l78"></a>* It is for one platformc -- </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64"><span class=cB4>x86_64</span></a><span class=cB0> desktop PC compatibles, more like 
<a name="l79"></a>super-computers than battery efficient wimpy mobiles.
<a name="l80"></a>
<a name="l81"></a>* All hardware access will be done through x86 IN/OUT instructions, not PCI 
<a name="l82"></a>drivers.  A frame buffer for VGA is an exception.
<a name="l83"></a>
<a name="l84"></a>* One driver for each class of device.  Limited exceptions are allowed.  With 
<a name="l85"></a>divergent device capabilities, it is a nightmare for user applications and what 
<a name="l86"></a>is gained?  A three buuton mouse is like a leg you cannot put weight on.
<a name="l87"></a>
<a name="l88"></a>* </span><span class=cB2>Ring-0-only</span><span class=cB0>.  Everything runs in kernel mode, including user applications.
<a name="l89"></a>
<a name="l90"></a>* Full access to everything.  All memory, I/O ports, instructions, and similar 
<a name="l91"></a>things must never be off limits.  All functions, variables and class members 
<a name="l92"></a>will be accessible.  There are no C++ </span><span class=cB2>public</span><span class=cB0>/</span><span class=cB2>private</span><span class=cB0> protections and all 
<a name="l93"></a>functions, even secondary ones in the kernel, can be called.
<a name="l94"></a>
<a name="l95"></a>* </span><span class=cB2>Single-address-map</span><span class=cB0> as though paging is not used.  Long mode requires paging, 
<a name="l96"></a>however, so the nearest thing is keeping all memory </span><span class=cB2>identity-mapped</span><span class=cB0>.
<a name="l97"></a>
<a name="l98"></a>* </span><span class=cB4>No networking</span><span class=cB0>, so malware is not an issue.
<a name="l99"></a>
<a name="l100"></a>* No encryption or passwords.  Files are compressed, not encrypted.
<a name="l101"></a>
<a name="l102"></a>* </span><span class=cB2>Free</span><span class=cB0> and </span><span class=cB2>public domain</span><span class=cB0>.
<a name="l103"></a>
<a name="l104"></a>* </span><span class=cB2>100% open source</span><span class=cB0> with all source included.
<a name="l105"></a>
<a name="l106"></a>* Documents are not for printing.  They're dynamic, intended for the scrn.
<a name="l107"></a>
<a name="l108"></a>* Just one 8x8 fixed-width font.  </span><span class=cB4>No Unicode, just Extended ASCII</span><span class=cB0>.  Other 
<a name="l109"></a>countries can make their own versions.  The versions should be just for one 
<a name="l110"></a>language and platform.
<a name="l111"></a>
<a name="l112"></a>* </span><span class=cB4>No multimedia</span><span class=cB0>.  Sounds and images will be primarily calculated in real-time, 
<a name="l113"></a>not fetched from storage.

<a name="l123"></a>
<a name="l124"></a>The compiler's parser makes RISC code which it optimizes to CISC.  I discovered 
<a name="l125"></a>this does not matter because the CPU converts it back to RISC and schedules it, 
<a name="l126"></a>internally.  A TempleOS zealot with more zeal than I, might say we should save 
<a name="l127"></a>lines-of-code by removing the CISC optimizing.
