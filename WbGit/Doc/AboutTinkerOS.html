<a name="l10"></a></span><span class=cB5>Why TinkerOS:</span><span class=cB0>
<a name="l11"></a>The vast majority of the code is written by Terry Davis.  I forked TempleOS and 
<a name="l12"></a>restored old functionality and added apps and improvements I thought were 
<a name="l13"></a>useful.  I wanted to get it to run baremetal on more of my machines and hoped 
<a name="l14"></a>others would likewise be interested in running it baremetal.  I had hoped there 
<a name="l15"></a>would be more community interest, but after many years of lack of contributions 
<a name="l16"></a>and for other reasons stated in the next section I am mostly done working on the 
<a name="l17"></a>project.  That being said I am definitely always willing to consider integrating 
<a name="l18"></a>any useful community contributions in the future should such a pull request come 
<a name="l19"></a>my way.
<a name="l20"></a>
<a name="l21"></a>
<a name="l22"></a></span><span class=cB5>Why The Tinkerer:</span><span class=cB0>
<a name="l23"></a>I go by the pseudonym &quot;The Tinkerer&quot; because sadly many in the &quot;TempleOS 
<a name="l24"></a>community&quot; enjoy harassing anyone who tries to take TempleOS seriously.  
<a name="l25"></a>KiwiFarms and other online bullies are directly responsible for the mental 
<a name="l26"></a>decline and death of Terry and many others.  I know people who have been 
<a name="l27"></a>harassed online, by phone, and by mail to there personal homes.  I have been 
<a name="l28"></a>harassed by numerous people numerous ways over many years.  Sadly after years of 
<a name="l29"></a>this I am to the point where I cannot even help someone new because multiple 
<a name="l30"></a>people have made fake accounts just to pretend to ask TempleOS questions for the 
<a name="l31"></a>sole purpose of trolling me for laughs.  I have had roughly 10 times as many 
<a name="l32"></a>fake trolling interactions with people than legitimate interactions with people 
<a name="l33"></a>who really want to learn HolyC and to program with the TempleOS API.

<a name="l38"></a></span><span class=cB5>About Me:</span><span class=cB0>
<a name="l39"></a>
<a name="l40"></a>I am Catholic and believe in God.  I do not believe it is appropriate to use 
<a name="l41"></a>TempleOS/TinkerOS as an oracle to demand instantaneous responses from God.  God 
<a name="l42"></a>hears prayers and responds to worthy prayers from worthy people.  God does not 
<a name="l43"></a>typically grant random words to be interpreted as answers to people on demand.  
<a name="l44"></a>Look </span><a href="https://tinkeros.github.io/WbGit/Doc/God.html"><span class=cB4>here for my thoughts on God and TempleOS</span></a><span class=cB0>
<a name="l45"></a>
<a name="l46"></a>I have degrees in Mathematics and Physics.  I worked professionally as a 
<a name="l47"></a>mathematician and software engineer doing cyber security and machine learning
<a name="l48"></a>for more than 20 years.  My favorite programming languages are C and Python.  I 
<a name="l49"></a>also program in Assembly, bash, C++, Perl, Matlab/Octave and HolyC.
<a name="l50"></a>
<a name="l51"></a>I have been a long time Linux enthusiast.  I made the switch from Windows to 
<a name="l52"></a>Linux way back in 1996 when it was actually a pain to install and you had to 
<a name="l53"></a>play the human package manager game.
<a name="l54"></a>
<a name="l55"></a>I have read the entire Bible (including the Catholic Bible only books that 
<a name="l56"></a>Martin Luther decided he didn't like), the Catechism of the Catholic Church and 
<a name="l57"></a>numerous Christian Apologetics books.
<a name="l58"></a>
<a name="l59"></a>I have almost read all 100,000 lines of Terry's code.
<a name="l60"></a>
<a name="l61"></a>I enjoy programming in HolyC because it reminds me of how C compilers used to be 
<a name="l62"></a>before people decided they need to hold everyone's hand and emit all kinds of 
<a name="l63"></a>annoying warnings and errors for things that are not necessarily errors in the 
<a name="l64"></a>name of improving security.
<a name="l65"></a>
<a name="l66"></a>I enjoy programming in TempleOS because HolyC is a magnificent language and 
<a name="l67"></a>TempleOS has a nice C like API that is easy to use and understand.
<a name="l68"></a>
<a name="l69"></a>I enjoy working with electronics and micro-controllers.
<a name="l70"></a>
<a name="l71"></a>I enjoy making my own PCBs, laser cutting and 3D printing projects.
<a name="l72"></a>
<a name="l73"></a>I recommend the following podcasts (even if you are not Catholic):
<a name="l74"></a>* </span><a href="https://media.ascensionpress.com/category/ascension-podcasts/bibleinayear/"><span class=cB4>The Bible in a Year</span></a><span class=cB0>
<a name="l75"></a>* </span><a href="https://ascensionpress.com/pages/catechisminayear"><span class=cB4>The Catechism in a Year</span></a><span class=cB0>
<a name="l76"></a>
<a name="l77"></a>Star Trek &gt; Star Wars, though I enjoy them both.
<a name="l78"></a>
<a name="l79"></a>I have watched every Star Trek episode at least once, most multiple times.  (I 
<a name="l80"></a>even forced myself to suffer through the original series). 
<a name="l81"></a>
<a name="l82"></a>My most recent favorite sci-fi book series is:  </span><span class=cB4>
<a name="l83"></a></span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F7T8NPK"><span class=cB4>The Expeditionary Force Series by Craig Alanson</span></a><span class=cB0>
